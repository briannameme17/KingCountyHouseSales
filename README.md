## Overview
This project presents a Tableau dashboard analyzing real estate transactions in King County, Washington. The dashboard provides interactive filtering, visual breakdowns of sales prices, and key insights into housing trends, conditions, and distributions across multiple dimensions.


## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to leverage Tableau for real estate analytics, enabling users to:

## Data Preparation
- Cleaned and formatted the raw housing dataset.
- Created calculated fields (e.g., daily average price, price bins, frequency counts).
- Applied filters for year built, square footage (living and lot), and calendar-based date selection.
- Built heatmaps to compare property condition against view quality.
